# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `ChoiceN` types, representing concrete coproduct implementations that are also `Functor` and `BiFunctor`
- `toMap`, `last`, `cons`, `prependAll`, `intersperse`
- `Tuple2/3/4#into`, for applying the values in a tuple as positional arguments to a function.

### Changed
- `CoProductN.[a-e]()` static factory methods moved to equivalent `ChoiceN` class. Coproduct interfaces now solely represent methods, no longer have anonymous implementations, and no longer require a `Functor` constraint

## [1.5.5] - 2016-12-17
### Added
- `CoProductN#project`, to project disjoint union types into tuples of `Optional` values
- `CoProductN#converge`, to drop the magnitude of a coproduct down by one type
- `toCollection` and `size`

### Changed
- semigroups and monoids moved under `fn2` package

## [1.5.4] - 2016-11-27
### Added
- `Fn1/2#adapt` to switch between lambda and `java.util.function` types more easily
- `eq`, `head`, `find`, and `tail`
- `BiPredicate`
- `Monoid#foldMap`
- `HMap#toMap` to go from a heterogeneous map to a `java.util.Map`

## [1.5.3] - 2016-11-06
### Added
- `Semigroup` and `Monoid`
- `Either#invert`
- `partition`
- Generalized coproducts implemented as `CoProduct2` through `CoProduct5`
- `Either` is now a `CoProduct2` 

## [1.5.2] - 2016-09-24
### Added
- Heterogeneous list indexes arrive via `Index`

### Changed
- `Lens` static factory method renaming

## [1.5.1] - 2016-08-30
### Added
- Independent `Lens` parameter mapping via `mapS`, `mapT`, `mapA`, and `mapB`

## [1.5] - 2016-08-28
### Added
- Initial lens support with `Lens` and `SimpleLens` types and `view`, `set`, and `over` functions
- `Const` and `Identity` functors
- `Either#toOptional`
- `HMap#remove` and `HMap#removeAll`

## [1.4] - 2016-08-08
### Changed
- All function input values become `java.util.function` types, and all function output values remain lambda types, for better compatibility

## [1.3] - 2016-07-31
### Added
- `HList` specializations support random access lookup

### Changed
- `Profunctor` inheritance hierarchy
- Renaming `Identity` to `Id`
- `Monadic/Dyadic/TriadicFunction` is now `Fn1/2/3`

## [1.2] - 2016-06-27
### Added
- `Either#peek`
- `HMap`, heterogeneous maps
- `Tuple2` is now also a `Map.Entry`

### Changed
- `Tuple`s moved under `HList` as specialized subtypes

## [1.1] - 2016-06-21
### Added
- `scanLeft`
- `HList`, heterogenous lists
- Added up to `Tuple5`
- `Either`, specialized coproduct with success/failure semantics

### Changed
- Better interoperability between lambda and `java.util.function` types

## [1.0] - 2015-12-29
### Added
- Initial implementation of first-class curried functions 
- `all`, `any`, `cartesianProduct`, `cycle`, `drop`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `foldLeft`,
  `foldRight`, `inGroupsOf`, `map`, `partial2`, `partial3`, `reduceLeft`, `reduceRight`,
  `repeat`, `take`, `takeWhile`, `unfoldr`
- `Monadic/Dyadic/TriadicFunction`, `Predicate`, `Tuple2`, `Tuple3`
- `Functor`, `BiFunctor`, `ProFunctor`
